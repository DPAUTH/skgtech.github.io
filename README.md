## Help us build the new website!

The `master` branch is deprecated, we are all working on `next` now.

Help us complete it by taking up one of [the issues](https://github.com/skgtech/skgtech.github.io/issues).

The design we are working on can be found on [zeplin.io](https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=5586f77a36a6c2022e227cce&sid=55e85b45ec010dba45a9a8be), ask for access in the #skgtech.io channel in slack.
